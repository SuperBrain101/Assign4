      <p>
        Hello! I'm a dedicated student at Wake Tech, pursuing an Associate's degree in Web Development. My journey into the tech world began with several programming courses at Wake Tech, where I discovered my passion for web development.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am captivated by every aspect of web development and strive to understand the entire process from start to finish. My goal is to master both the front-end and back-end, ensuring I can create seamless, efficient, and user-friendly websites and applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, I am working on a real-world project for a nonprofit organization, which I aim to complete by the end of this month. This experience has been incredibly enriching, allowing me to apply my skills in a practical setting while contributing to a meaningful cause. Through this project, I've learned how to use GitHub in a teamwork coding environment, as well as mastering Bootstrap and responsiveness strategies to create adaptable and visually appealing websites.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to my technical skills, my previous work experience in the restaurant industry has taught me the importance of teamwork, collaboration, and communication. These roles have honed my ability to work effectively with others and manage tasks efficiently. My time working in warehouse jobs has instilled in me a strong work ethic and the ability to handle physically demanding tasks with diligence and perseverance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moreover, having taken remote classes, I am well-versed in managing tasks independently, staying organized, and meeting deadlines without direct supervision. This experience has further developed my ability to work autonomously and maintain productivity in a remote setting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Driven by curiosity and a passion for continuous learning, I eagerly anticipate the future and the limitless opportunities it holds in the ever-evolving world of web development. I am excited about the prospect of bringing my skills, enthusiasm, and dedication to a dynamic team, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing as your future web developer.
